# Educational Background | Test Task

## How to start the application:

1. Make sure database connection data is updated in the .env file
2. run ```composer install``` to download all required php packages.
3. run the migrations with the seed flag ``` php artisan migrate:fresh --seed ``` This
will create database tables and fill them with data from the json file sent with the task.
4. run the serve command to start the server ```php artisan serve```
5. For your convenience, I have also hosted both applications online:
